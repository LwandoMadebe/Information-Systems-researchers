### Introduction
 The field of Information Systems (IS) is a dynamic and diverse area of study, continually
 evolving as technology advances and our understanding of business processes deepens. In this
 assignment, as a group of 3, we will delve into the myriad topics that IS researchers focus on.. we will be using
 R for analysis and data visualization, to look into a dataset spanning from 2011 to 2020. In
 our exploration, we will employ text analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models
 such as Structural Topic Model (STM), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and Correlated
 Topic Model (CTM). These sophisticated models will enable us to extract meaningful insights
 from our dataset, revealing patterns and trends in IS research over the past decade.The aim
 of this assignment is to offer a comprehensive understanding of this dynamic field.
